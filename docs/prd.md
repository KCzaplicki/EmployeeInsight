# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - EmployeeInsight

## 1. Product Overview

EmployeeInsight is an application designed to help organizations gather and analyze feedback about employee performance through customizable surveys. The platform enables managers to create, distribute, and analyze surveys that measure employee performance and engagement. It provides actionable insights to managers while allowing employees to view their performance metrics over time.

The application leverages AI technology to analyze survey results and provide personalized feedback and improvement recommendations to both managers and employees. EmployeeInsight features dedicated dashboards for managers and employees, allowing each user type to access relevant information and insights.

The system supports three main user roles:
- Administrators: Manage user accounts and system access
- Managers: Create and distribute surveys, analyze results, and manage employee profiles
- Employees: Complete surveys about colleagues and view feedback about their own performance

This MVP (Minimum Viable Product) focuses on delivering core functionality to enable the feedback collection and analysis process, with potential for expansion in future releases.
